#  CX NextGen Framework Early Access

Web UI (User Interface) Automation Testing Framework

CX NextGen Framework provides a powerful and versatile platform to author Test Cases in Code Driven, Behavior Driven or Keyword Driven approach. It is a right tool for Web Platform test automation solution using Selenium. CX NextGen Framework benefits Rimsys QA Team in developing highly maintainable and repeatable tests that utilize reusable test assets, proper modularity and semantic structure. Descriptive Reporting satisfies high-level as well as low-level (debugging) aspects.

	The framework is built upon java and integrates TestNG, Selenium/Webdriver.
	Due to the framework's thorough design, test developer does not need to worry
	about common tasks such as thread safe browser session for running test in
	parallel, reporting. The tests run can be configured through standard testing
	configuration files, the test run filters and behavior can be changed
	within the XML File. The architecture of the framework ensures efficiency
	to develop test cases and low maintenance while supporting extensibility by:
  
  
* Adopted SRP Design Pattern
>  Following framework accepted SRP design pattern in creating the core functionalities within the framework.
*  Super code reusability and portability for testing teamâ€™s speed and efficiency
>  Providing an approach to develop highly maintainable and repeatable tests that utilize reusable test assets, proper modularity and semantic structure. Framework has readymade services for most 'Selenium' workflow, browser actions, reporting and data reading. Also, framework concept is based on page object model so your page and related actions will be reusable from any test case. There is a good screen shot facility is available also.
